# Neural Networks


## Basic Structure

Below is a very simple neural network:

The meanings of these symbols:

- $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the input.
- $w_1$ and $w_2$ are weights.
- $y$ is the output.

The computation in the neural network:

- $a = x_1 w_1 + x_2 w_2 + b$
- $y = h(a)$

Explanations:

- $a$ is the weighted sum of the input.
- $b$ is bias.
- $h(x)$ is activation function.
