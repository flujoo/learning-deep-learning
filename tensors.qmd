# Tensors

Tensors are an abstraction of vectors or matrices. It is a data representation used in deep learning.

A tensor has three attributes:

1. number of axes (rank)
2. shape
3. data type

For example, vectors are rank-1 or 1D tensors. The following is a vector:

```python
array([12, 3, 6, 14, 7])
```

Please note that this is a 5-dimensional vector. It has only one axis, but has five dimensions along this axis.

Scalars are rank-0 tensors. Matrices are rank-2 tensors.
